# Perceivable

---

## Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.

---

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary"><i class="fa fa-trash"></i></button>
```

becomes

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary"><i class="fa fa-trash"></i> Remove</button>
<button class="btn btn-primary" aria-label="Remove"><i class="fa fa-trash"></i></button>
```

---

```html
<img class="img-responsive" src="xyz.png" />
```

becomes

```html
<img class="img-responsive" alt="An image of XYZ" src="xyz.png" />
```

*_NOT_*

```html
<img class="img-responsive" alt="xyz.png" src="xyz.png" />
```

---

## Provide alternatives for time-based media

Provide captions or transcripts for your audio/visual content. Sign language for live events.

---

## Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure

Semantic structure matters! Tab order matters!

---

![](img/pour_with-css.png)

---

![](img/pour_wo-css.png)

---

## Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background

---

```html
<div class="alert alert-danger">This is some text</div>
```

becomes

```html
<div class="alert alert-danger"><i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i> This is some text</div>
```

---

## Focus

Does the element have a focus state that clearly indicates that it is currently in focus?

If your page refreshes data, does it retain focus on the right data?

---

## Contrast

## WCAG 2.0 AA: 4.5:1 / 3.1 (large text)

![](img/color-contrast.png)

---

# Operable

---

## Make all functionality available from a keyboard

---

```jsx
<img onClick={() => this.props.callback()} />
```

becomes

```jsx
<img onClick={/* ... */} onKeyPress={(event) => event.key === 'Enter' && this.props.callback()} />
```

---

## Provide users enough time to read and use content

---

## Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures

---

## Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are

<ul style={{ listStyle: 'none', paddingLeft: '0' }}>
    <Appear>
        <li>Semantic headings: one <code>h1</code> per page, decrement headings</li>
        <li>Labels on form elements</li>
        <li>Use of <code>&lt;main /></code>, <code>&lt;section /></code>, and <code>&lt;article /></code> </li>
        <li>"Skip to" or "Skip Navigation" links</li>
    </Appear>
</ul> 

---

# Understandable

---

## Make text content readable and understandable

Set a language on your page! `<html lang="en">`

Or mark individual bits as another language: `<span lang="fr">C'est la vie</span> isn't in English.`

Use `<abbr>` when applicable

---

## Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways

<ul style={{ listStyle: 'none', paddingLeft: '0' }}>
    <Appear>
        <li>Manage focus state, especially in SPA's</li>
        <li>Consistent navigation</li>
        <li>Don't change the interface without user input ...</li>
        <li>... or change the interface while users are interacting with it</li>
    </Appear>
</ul> 

---

## Help users avoid and correct mistakes
